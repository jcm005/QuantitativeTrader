# Current Bugs To fix

data_grabber not responding to time interval hour or day this is relatively a new problem since the upload to github i believe probelwm is DG is not outputting any info to the file

api is not returning any info 

**update the data_grabber is fine it is cerebro that is the problem the data feed apparently not being excepted for the day'' opetion howecer it is excepted for hour and minuts the only difference between the two datasets is the time information days is 00:00:00 where as in hour or minutes it contains numbers not zeros'

**update hour is still not working
