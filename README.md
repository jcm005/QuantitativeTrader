# Trader

Welcome, in this Repo, you will find two series of frameworks. Live_trading 
and Back_Testing framework.

The Back_Testing platform is based on backtraders' infrastructure https://www.backtrader.com
which receives historical stock data with variables declared in test.py . It is named test.py because it is the primary platform that strategies can be built on.

The Live_Trading repository allows for the implementation of your developed algorithm into real-time.
